# Influence of Unfunded-Aid on Enrollment


Unfunded Aid Project
## Overview
The Unfunded Aid Project is an analytical study conducted to understand the impact of unfunded aid on student enrollment decisions at a higher education institution. The primary goal is to determine if offering unfunded aid at the time of admission significantly influences applicants to accept and enroll. This project leverages a dataset from 2020 to explore enrollment patterns based on various demographics such as citizenship, gender, and race.

## Hypothesis
The project is based on the hypothesis that applicants who receive an unfunded aid offer when they receive their letter of admission are more likely to accept and enroll.

### Impact by Citizenship:

Permanent Residents are more likely to enroll even without aid.
International students are significantly influenced by aid (50.4%).
U.S. citizens are likely to enroll even without aid.
Impact by Gender and Race:

United States Citizens:
More females enrolled without aid.
White individuals enrolled more even without aid.
Asian-Asian American enroll more when given aid.
International:
More males enrolled without aid.
Asians tend to apply more when given aid.
Black individuals applied almost similarly with or without aid.
Permanent Residents:
Both females and males enrolled with or without aid, but females with aid are slightly more likely to enroll.
White individuals enroll more when provided aid.
Asians enroll more when given aid.
Black individuals enroll more with aid.

### Scholarship Tier Analysis:

Various scholarship tiers were analyzed, showing that higher levels of aid (G9, G10) were mostly awarded to international students, while lower levels (G1, G2, G3) had more domestic recipients.

### Program-Specific Insights:

Programs such as the Accounting Professional (MPAC Advanced) and Counseling (Clinical Mental Health Counseling specialization) showed high acceptance rates with aid.
Statistical Significance:

The Chi-square test of independence confirmed a significant association between receiving aid and accepting the offer, with a Chi-square statistic of 46.39 and a P-value of 9.6888e-12.

## Methodology
Data Analysis: The analysis included examining enrollment patterns based on demographic variables (citizenship, gender, race) and the amount of aid received.
Statistical Testing: The Chi-square test of independence was used to determine the statistical significance of the association between receiving aid and enrollment decisions.
Visualization: Data visualization tools were employed to illustrate the impact of unfunded aid across different demographics.

## Insights and Recommendations
Offering unfunded aid significantly impacts international students' enrollment decisions.
Domestic students, particularly females and white individuals, are more likely to enroll without aid.
Higher aid levels are effective in attracting international students, while lower aid levels suffice for domestic students.
The institution could strategically allocate aid to maximize enrollment, focusing on higher aid for international applicants and targeted lower aid for domestic applicants in specific programs.

## Conclusion
The Unfunded Aid Project highlights the importance of financial aid in influencing enrollment decisions. The analysis provides valuable insights for the institution to refine its aid allocation strategy, ensuring that financial aid offers effectively attract and retain students across diverse demographics.
